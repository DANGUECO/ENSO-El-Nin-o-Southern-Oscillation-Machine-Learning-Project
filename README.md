# ENSO-El-Nin-o-Southern-Oscillation-Machine-Learning-Project
The El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a cycle of warm and cold surface sea water temperatures in the southern Paciﬁc Ocean. As the area of warm sea water moves the air pressure gets higher on either the east or west of the Paciﬁc. This has an eﬀect on rainfall and temperature globally, but given our geographic location, it has a very strong eﬀect on New Zealand weather. The cycle varies between two and seven years, with an average of four years.

We will try to investigate exactly what kind of eﬀect it has on New Zealand. To also see if i can predict the strength of the El Nin˜o into the future.
