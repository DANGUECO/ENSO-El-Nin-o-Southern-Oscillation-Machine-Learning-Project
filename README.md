# ENSO-El-Nin-o-Southern-Oscillation-Machine-Learning-Project----
The El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a successive continous cycle of warm and cold surface sea water temperatures in the southern Paciﬁc Ocean. As the area of warm sea water moves the air pressure gets higher on either the east or west of the paciﬁc. This has an eﬀect on rainfall and temperature globally, but given our geographic location, it has a very very strong eﬀect on New Zealand weather. The cycle varies between two and seven years, with an average of four years.

GOAL: To investigate what kind of eﬀect it has on New Zealand, and to also see.. if we can predict the strength of El Nin˜o into the future.......
